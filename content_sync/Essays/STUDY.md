### **Abstract**

This document presents a non-metaphysical structural model in which awareness is not ontologically primary, but emerges from constrained physical structure through relational information integration and recursive modeling. The model rejects metaphysical authorship and ontological monopoly while preserving precision, explanatory coherence, and scientific integrity. Reality is framed as physically instantiated structured energy. Information is derivative of structure. Interiority is derivative of recursive integration. Awareness is a high-order structural phenomenon. This is not a retreat from depth. It is a compression toward clarity.
